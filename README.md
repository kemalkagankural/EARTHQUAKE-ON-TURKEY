Turkey or the Mediterranean Environment of the Alpine-Himalayan Belt and the world every year, called the earthquake the earthquake occurred in approximately 20% - 25 's is located in the most dangerous parts of the region is formed. When geological periods, historical periods and instrumental current period earthquake activities are examined, it is clear that the earthquake hazard in this country is extremely high.

Turkey West Aegean starting from the sea extending up to Lake Van dextral strike-slip North Anatolian Fault, Dead Sea fault extending to Hatay, starting from the Red Sea in the south, starting from Hatay Erzincan near the North Anatolian Fault intersects the East Anatolian Fault and the Aegean It is controlled by the fault systems that make up the Graben System, and there are large earthquakes due to the faults forming the said fault systems. In addition, the Ecemiş fault, which starts from Niğde and extends to Mersin, starts from Niğde and extends to Ankara. it is coiled.

Turkey's tectonic characteristics, both geological, historical and instrumental both in the current period is a major cause of devastating earthquakes often live. Archaeological evidence proves the existence of large earthquakes that have led to the destruction of ancient civilizations, particularly in the West, Inner West, North West Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean. Earthquakes are natural geological phenomena, and people turn into disasters.
For the transformation of earthquakes into disasters; errors in site selection, errors in project design, errors in material selection, application errors during construction, inadequacies in inspection play a major role.

*For these reasons and I focused on Turkey earthquake. This project based on the data we calculated that Turkey should be more cautious against earthquakes which of the province. After that we have formed our research question.*
 
In preparing my project, I used the Mercalli intensity scale as the earthquake intensity scale. Based on the values of 4 and above, we have created the necessary and unnecessary classes.
## PROJECT RESEARCH QUESTION:
**Based on data from 1910-2017, does the cities should make preventions against the earthquake in Turkey?**
